Title: Power Simulations for RNA-sequencing
Description: Recent development of very sensitive RNA-seq
       protocols, such as Smart-seq2 and CEL-seq allows
       transcriptional profiling at single-cell resolution and
       droplet devices make single cell transcriptomics
       high-throughput, allowing to characterize thousands or
       even millions of single cells. In powsimR, we have
       implemented a flexible tool to assess power and sample
       size requirements for differential expression (DE)
       analysis of single cell and bulk RNA-seq experiments. For
       our read count simulations, we (1) reliably model the
       mean, dispersion and dropout distributions as well as the
       relationship between those factors from the data. (2)
       Simulate read counts from the empirical mean-variance and
       dropout relations, while offering flexible choices of the
       number of differentially expressed genes, effect sizes
       and DE testing method. (3) Finally, we evaluate the power
       over various sample sizes. The number of replicates
       required to achieve the desired statistical power is
       mainly determined by technical noise and biological
       variability and both are considerably larger if the
       biological replicates are single cells. powsimR can not
       only estimate sample sizes necessary to achieve a certain
       power, but also informs about the power to detect DE in a
       data set at hand. We believe that this type of posterior
       analysis will become more and more important, if results
       from different studies are to be compared. Often enough
       researchers are left to wonder why there is a lack of
       overlap in DE-genes across similar experiments. PowsimR
       will allow the researcher to distinguish between actual
       discrepancies and incongruities due to lack of power.
